Overview
===============================

Registrations, match-making, scoring and data capturing are all managed automatically by a script.

The code was tested to make everything runs smoothly, but please be patient if bugs come up (as they always do!).
If you do spot any bugs, be a good citizen and report them! |:policeman:|

TL;DR
----------------------------

This is a summary of how the league works. If you have any questions, the answer could be somewhere else in this guide, but feel free to just ask in the group.

- Sign up to play by navigating to sheet `sign_up` of `this document <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OY-nmzJ7s2YsOrDKokKYcf3hjkkchkAWSAGc216eyA4/edit?usp=sharing>`_ and adding your name (if not already there) and a "Yes". Sign ups end every Sunday at 21:00.
- On Monday, check who your opponent is in sheet `match_ups` and schedule a match with them.
- Play a best of 5 sets match, with sets of 5 games and "sudden death" at deuce. When sets are 2-2 games, there's a tie-break and the first to 7 points (with 2 points difference) wins the set.
- Report the results in sheet `match_ups`.
- Keep track of league stats through the other sheets in the document.
