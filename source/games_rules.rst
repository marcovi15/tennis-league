Game rules
==============================

Match Format (For 1-Hour Games)
------------------------------------

- **Best of 5 short sets** (first to 3 sets wins the match).
- **Best of 5 games sets** (first to win 3 games wins the set, unless score is 2-2).
- **Tiebreak at 2-2 games** in a set (first to 7 points with 2 points difference wins the set).
- No-ad scoring (**"sudden death"** at deuce).
- If time runs out, whoever won more sets wins. If sets are even, whoever was ahead in the last set wins. If that is also even, it's a draw.

Equipment and booking
--------------------------------

Talk with your opponent before the match to schedule the game, and make sure you have enough balls between the two of you.
One of you will hopefully have an annual pass, but put a message in the group if not and someone will help you with that.
