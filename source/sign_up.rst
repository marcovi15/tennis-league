Signing up and Stats
==============================

You can sign up and access all the stats from this `Google Sheets document <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OY-nmzJ7s2YsOrDKokKYcf3hjkkchkAWSAGc216eyA4/edit?usp=sharing>`_.

.. WARNING:: Please do not change the structure of the tables (headers, sheet name, new columns...).

The spreadhseet has several sheets, each serving a different function.


Signing up for the game
----------------------------
If you want to sign up to play next week, do the following **before Sunday at 21:00**:

1. Navigate to the sheet `sign_up`.
2. Type your name in the `player` column, if it's not already there.
3. Type "Yes" next to your name, under the `playing` column (if you don't do this, the code will assume you're not playing).

You name should already be in the list next time, so please be careful not to enter it again.

Check the match-ups and play
----------------------------

On Sunday evening after 21:00, you should be able to see who you matched up against:

1. Navigate to the sheet `match_ups` and **see who your opponent is**.
2. **Schedule a game** with them some time before the following Sunday.
3. **Play the game** (see :doc:`games_rules` for the game rules).
4. **Enter the result** (number of sets per player) in `match_ups`. If you end up not playing, leave it blank.

.. Note:: If an odd number of people sign up for the week, one will be selected to skip the game. This will either be the person with the highest number of games played, or one selected at random.


Check the stats
----------------------------
The rest of the sheets are locked, so you cannot edit them, but you can use them to see the league stats:
- `ranking` shows the overall leaderboard, with number of points and games played.
- `past_results` is a register of all the games played so far, labelled by week.
- `points` is a register of the points earned at every round by each player. These are not weighed, so the overall leaderboard may not perfectly match these.

Cool visulisations of key stats **might** come at some point in the future if this project takes off.
