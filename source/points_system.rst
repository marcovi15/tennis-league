Scoring system
==========================

Points system
------------------
- Win = 100 points + Bonus
- Draw = 50 points
- Loss = 30 points (to encourage participation)

A bonus is awarded if you win against someone higher than you in the ranking. The **bonus is equal to 20% of their total points**.

Ranking
-------------------
The league is **organised as a ladder**, which you can climb faster by winning, especially if you do so against players with more points than you.

To keep the league dynamic, **points expire over time**:
- Points are halved in value after 6 weeks.
- Points completely expire after 12 week.

**Whoever is top of the league after 12 weeks is the season winner.**

New starters will not start from 0 but from the same points as the last player in the ranking.
