Leamington Tennis League
===========================

Welcome to the Leamington  Tennis League! |:tennis:|

This guide should provide you with all the information you need to start playing, but if you have any doubts just ask Marco.

If you don't want to read all the details, there's a **TL;DR** section in the :doc:`overview` section.

Feel free to suggest any improvements to the rules and/or the league structure!
Finally, but most importantly, remember that this is all for fun and we're all mostly here to get better at tennis while meeting new people!
